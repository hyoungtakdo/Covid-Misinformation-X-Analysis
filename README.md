## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

The social media platform X (formerly Twitter) played a central role in shaping public understanding and misunderstanding during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project investigates how COVID-19 misinformation spread through user networks by analyzing repost (retweet/reply) behavior using the CoAID dataset.

By visualizing and analyzing the **reply network**, this study explores structural features such as:
- **Degree centrality**
- **Betweenness centrality**
- **Closeness centrality**
- **Clustering and density**

These metrics reveal influential users and suggest how misinformation may circulate within echo chambers online.
